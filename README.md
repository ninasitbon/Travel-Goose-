For our marketing project during my first semester at IE, we had to create a new product, with the primary objective to provide an opportunity for us to experience building marketing strategies from the perspective of professional marketers. 

That is why I thought of creating a new luxury good, as I am very interested in fashion. 

I chose the brand Golden Goose because I thought it would be the easiest one to expand, as the brand is very open to creativity and innovation. 

I wanted to expand their bag line and create a completely personalizable travel bag.
